PLAYER text:  Welcome  Acute Gon
Thanks for coming to argument Box, home of(mostly) vauge arguments, whats on your mind 
npc text:  <color=yellow> initial pattern: familyPerson</color> hmm, did you know that  Thomas Ann-Servatius has a big family and that is a lot of young shapes in one household.
 <color=yellow> Mapped SV:  FamilyPerson Rating: Low</color> 
I believe every shape bears a responsibility to their partner and their family. BUT a shape also needs to listen to what they want once a while.

npc text:  <color=yellow> initial pattern: socialLife</color> Thomas Ann-Servatius has a lot of friends! They are really popular!
 <color=yellow> Mapped SV:  Shapesarenothingifnotsocial Rating: High</color> 
I always find it awkward around quiet shapes. That's why I love sociable and approachable shapes. In fact, If they can't open up to you, how can you trust them?

No?! How could you say that?! I would never trust a shape who's closed off. what is the cnpc's stance (high/defend) (low/attack)high
 the full argument made by the cnpc was using the nurturanParent model <color=yellow> schema:high_Nurturance</color>I love how friendly this shape is. <color=blue> using the nurturanParent model </color><color=blue> FM used for the pattern  socialLife under the SV: Shapesarenothingifnotsocial</color> Don't you think = being surrounded by shapes you love is the best thing?
