Thanks for coming to argument Box, what rumors are on your mind? 

 npc text:  <color=yellow> initial pattern: familyPerson</color> hmm, did you know that  Thomas Ann-Servatius has a big family and that is a lot of young shapes in one household.
 <color=yellow> Mapped SV:  FamilyPerson Rating: Low</color> 
I believe every shape bears a responsibility to their partner and their family. BUT a shape also needs to listen to what they want once a while.
 
 other possible mappings for the pattern </color> familyPerson  <color=orange>includes:
</color><color=orange>Additional information:</color> <color=#ff6d00> [ FamilyPerson ]</color><color=#ff6d00> [ youthAreTheFuture ]</color>
<color=orange>other possible mappings for  SVsentences include:
</color><color=orange>Additional information:</color> <color=#ff6d00> [ The SV 'FamilyPerson' with a rating of high:I believe every shape bears a responsibility to their partner and their family. We have to honor that responsibility by doing what is right by them. ]</color><color=#ff6d00> [ The SV 'FamilyPerson' with a rating of mid:I believe every shape bears a responsibility to their partner and their family. ]</color><color=#ff6d00> [ The SV 'FamilyPerson' with a rating of low:I believe every shape bears a responsibility to their partner and their family. BUT a shape also needs to listen to what they want once a while. ]</color>
